# Assignment 2: Feature Extraction and Feature Selection
# Instructions
Make sure the folders of different user’s raw sensor data are present in CSE572_A2_data folder.
# Task 1 Annotation
•	Run task1.m file for task 1

•	This script segments the raw data in 10 different csv files corresponding to the 10 different gestures.
# Task 2 Feature Extraction and PCA
•	Run task2.m file for task 2

•	This script applies feature extraction algorithms like Mean, Variance, Root Mean Square (RMS), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete    Wavelet Transform (DWT) on the data from Task 1. Also, this script  applies PCA on the data feature matrix and plots the spider plots.


Note: Change the path names of the files/folders accordingly
