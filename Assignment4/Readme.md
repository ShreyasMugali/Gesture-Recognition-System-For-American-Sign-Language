# Assignment 4 - User Independent Analysis
# Instructions

# Task 1: New Feature Matrix Generation:
•	Run task1_ph4 for extracting the 10 different gestures of each user in 10 different csv files.

•	Run task2_ph4 for applying feature extraction methods on the CSV files generated. 

•	Run task3_ph4 for performing PCA

•	Run task4_ph4 for multiplying the feature extraction matrix by the first 5 columns of the PCA generated in last step.

•	Run task5_ph4 to form the data matrix required as an input for classification algorithms.

# Task 2: Training 
•	We divide the dataset obtained from the previous task into training and test sets. 

# Task 3: Testing
•	Run classify_ph4.m for Decision tree and SVM machines to generate the accuracy metrics describing precision, recall and F1 score.

•	Run nn_ph4.m for neural network to generate the accuracy metrics describing precision, recall and F1 score.
