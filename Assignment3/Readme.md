# Assignment 3 - User Dependent Analysis
# Instructions
Run task1_ph2.m, task2_ph2.m files before starting Assignment 3

# Task 1: New Feature Matrix Generation
•	Run task1_ph3 for extracting the 10 different gestures of each user in 10 different csv files.

•	Run task2_ph3 for applying feature extraction methods on the CSV files generated. 

•	Run task3_ph3 for multiplying the feature extraction matrix by the first 5 columns of the PCA generated earlier in assignment 2.

•	Run task4_ph3 to form the data matrix required as an input for classification algorithms.

# Task 2: Training 
We divide the dataset obtained from the previous task into training and test sets.

# Task 3: Testing
•	Run classify_ph3.m for Decision tree and SVM machines to generate the accuracy metrics describing precision, recall and F1 score.

•	Run nn_ph3.m for neural network to generate the accuracy metrics describing precision, recall and F1 score.
